A Software-based TPM and MTM Emulator. TPM 1.2 only.

- [TPM JavaScript emulator + demo](https://google.github.io/tpm-js/) _[active]_ <br>
TPM-JS lets you experiment with a software Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in your browser.

- [Simple TPM PK11](https://github.com/ThomasHabets/simple-tpm-pk11)  _[active]_ <br>
Simple PKCS11 provider for TPM chips. Supports OpenSSH.

- [TPM2 PK11](https://github.com/irtimmer/tpm2-pk11)  _[active]_ <br>
PKCS#11 module for TPM 2.0. Supports OpenSSH, Firefox and GnuPG.

- [Cryptsetup TPM incubator](https://github.com/AndreasFuchsSIT/cryptsetup-tpm-incubator) _[active]_ <br>
A fork of cryptsetup that adds an extension for adding TPM 2.0 support.

- [TSS.MSR](https://github.com/Microsoft/TSS.MSR) _[active]_ <br>
TPM Software Stack implementation from Microsoft Research.

- [tpmtopt](https://github.com/mjg59/tpmtotp) _[last commit 2016]_ <br>
Remote attestation of boot state using a TOTP token in another device. Can be used with e.g. Google Authenticator. Before requesting the disk decryption passphrase, a TOTP token is displayed on the screen that can be checked using another device (phone).

- [libtpms](https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms) _[active]_ <br>
Library providing software emulation of TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0. Targets the integration of TPM functionality into hypervisors (Qemu).

Portable TPM 2.0 project designed for embedded use.

- [Python TSS](https://github.com/mjg59/python-tss) _[last commit: 2016]_ <br>
Python library for interfacing with TPMs.

- [Microsoft TPM 2.0 ref](https://github.com/Microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref) _[active]_ <br>
Reference implementation of the TPM 2.0 specification by Microsoft.

- [IBM TPM2 TSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmtpm20tss/) _[active]_ <br>
IBM's implementation of TPM Software Stack. Functionality equivalent to TCG TSS, but different interface.

- [IBM Software TPM2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmswtpm2/) _[active]_ <br>
IBM's software TPM 2.0 simulator.

- [IBM TPM Attestation Client Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmtpm20acs/) _[active]_ <br>
Code for TCG attestation application.
